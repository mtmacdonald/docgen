> This project has moved to [github.com/inkit/docgen](https://github.com/inkit/docgen). The project is now owned by
Inkit Inc ([inkit.com](https://www.inkit.com)). I am no longer maintainer of DocGen open source, for any queries
please [contact Inkit](https://www.inkit.com/contact-us) directly.

DocGen is a command-line documentation tool for software products. It takes plain text or CommonMark (Markdown) as
input, and generates both a static website and a PDF copy.

See the [user guide](https://inkit.github.io/docgen/) for instructions.
