This section gives help on solving common issues with DocGen.

Displaying detailed errors
--------------------------

Pass the **-v** (verbose) option when running DocGen to get more detailed error messages.

PDF missing content
-------------------

In complex pages, the PDF generator (wkhtmltopdf) needs to be given enough time for dynamic content to be rendered.
Pass the **-d [milliseconds]** option to increase the rendering time for each page, if required.

Attached files not in PDF
-------------------------

Attached files are not converted to PDF, only the web content is.

Corrupted text characters
-------------------------

Make sure all the input text files are saved with UTF-8 encoding.

Missing logo
------------

The logo must be PNG format and saved with the path *files/images/logo.svg* or *files/images/logo.png* and it must have
suitable dimensions for the header (height and width).

Other issues
------------
