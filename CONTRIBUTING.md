## I Have a Question

If you have a question about DocGen, please first read the
[documentation](https://mtmacdonald.github.io/docgen/docs/index.html) and search the Internet first, in case there is
already a community answer to your question.

### Reporting Bugs

Before submitting a bug report, please first:

- Make sure that you are using the latest version
- Read the [documentation](https://mtmacdonald.github.io/docgen/docs/index.html)
- Search the [ticket list](https://github.com/mtmacdonald/docgen/issues?q=label%3Abug) for existing issues experienced
  by others. If you find one, please add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue?
- Is it really a bug and not an environment or usage error on your side?

If you still want to submit a bug report, please investigate carefully and collect as much information as so that we
can find and fix the issue efficiently, including:

- Minimal test case to reproduce the issue (e.g. link to a repository with the simplest possible example of the issue)
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior and actual behavior
- Any error output or logs
- Stack trace if applicable
- Platform information (OS and version, Node version etc.)

Bugs should be reported in the [ticket list](https://github.com/mtmacdonald/docgen/issues?q=label%3Abug) with
label `bug`.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Ideas are welcome for improving DocGen, including new features, and minor enhancements.

Please first read the [documentation](https://mtmacdonald.github.io/docgen/docs/index.html) to make sure your idea is not already supported, and check the
[ticket list](https://github.com/mtmacdonald/docgen) to make see if a ticket already exists for
your idea.

If not, please submit a new ticket with as much context as possible (current behaviour, desired behaviour, why you need
it etc.).

## Improving The Documentation

Our [documentation](https://mtmacdonald.github.io/docgen/docs/index.html) is hosted by Github Pages. It is authored
in Markdown and generated by the DocGen tool itself. Improvements to the documentation are always welcome (see the
